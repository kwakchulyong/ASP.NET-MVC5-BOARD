ASP.NET MVC5(.NET Framework 4.6.1)

I installed several packages to create a bulletin board. Just run the command in the console window.

Tool->NuGet Package Manager->Package Manager Console

-Installed Entity Framework 6.
Install-Package EntityFramework

-Installed PagedList.MVC NuGet 
Install-Package PagedList.Mvc

I implemented the CRUD function on the bulletin board, and I entered 100 people who were sent to Excel.
